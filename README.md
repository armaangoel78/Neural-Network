# Neural-Network
An artificial neural network designed to solve the XOR gate problem in computing. This was my second machine learning project, and built of my XOR perceptron network, but this was one neural network, rather than 3 connected perceptron networks, and was thus a much more advanced project even though it solved the same problem.
